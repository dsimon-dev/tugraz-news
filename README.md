# TU Graz News

An android app for reading TU Graz newsgroups.

## Update

As I've lost motivation, and the TU Graz is moving away from Newsgroups and towards TeachCenter & Discord, I have stopped working on this app.

## Features

### Working

- Search and add newsgroups
- Articles grouped into threads
- Reddit-style thread view with indentation
- Basic text styling (quotes, hyperlinks, signatures)
- Caching of headers and articles
- Dark theme

### TODO

- Mark as read/unread
- Write articles & replies
- Offline support
- Attachments
 
Feel free to contribute.
